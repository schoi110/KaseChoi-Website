        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Medical Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kase Choi a pre-medical student that is aspiring to become a physician. Ever since I was in highschool I began to have an interest for biology, but in particular to human physiology. I loved learning about how the body worked and I would question all the things about my body. Then slowly, my interests changed to illnesses. Whenever my friends got sick or got hurt, I would always try to diagnose them myself by looking up and researching on google. I had this passion to treat and heal others. I wanted this knowledge to be able to help others in this way. Soon after, I became known as Doctor Google amongst my friends and I entered college with biology as my major.<br><br>

        Since entering college, I began involving myself in clinical shiftings at Adventist Health White Memorial and shadowing there as well. Additionally, I shadowed an oncologist at Montclair Medical Hospital. Throughout these experiences, I have been able to confirm my interests in purusing to become a physician as it has been extremely rewarding to see improvements in health of the patients. Furthermore, I involved myself in campus clubs such as Global Medical Missions Alliance where I took part in weekly meetings listening to health professionals and even going on medical missions to Honduras. I want to further my experiences by going on more medical mission trips, helping physicians, and understanding more of the profession.<br><br>

        As I am continuing to learn more about the medical field and learning about ways that I can help my friends around me, it excites me that I can be of help to those in need. In the future, I want to become a physician and also host my own medical mission trips to other countries that are in need. Although this path to medicine is long and gruesome, I hope that I can endure the trials that I will face all to give God the glory. I currently plan to take a gap year to gain more experience and to also enjoy some time before entering medical school. However, in during this gap year, I will be serving in different countries. Furthermore, I plan to work in a hospital setting so that I can continue to be exposed to the health system and learn more about what it is really like.
